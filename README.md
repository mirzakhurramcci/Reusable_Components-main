In this iOS tutorial, we’ll build an ios app to demonstrate how to create such [reusable iOS components in iphone apps](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/create-reusable-ios-components-tutorial/).

While this solution looks pretty simple, the complexity of putting in the right context may arise depending on the app. So, to get the best results, consult with an [iPhone app development company](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/iphone-app-development/) to ensure implementation job is done correctly.
